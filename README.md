# Input Manager JS

`npm i @whoisryosuke/input-manager`

### Lint and Code Formatting

If you use VSCode, Prettier should run each time you save a compatible file.

> If you don't like this, go to `.vscode\settings.json` and disable there (or you can do it via your own VSCode settings).

`yarn lint` runs ESLint and Prettier, automatically formats files and rewrites them. Make sure to stage your code before running just in case.
